In Python, a Module is simply a single file ending in .py that contains code
(functions, variables, or classes).

Modules allow you to break that program into smaller, organized files.
    -login.py (Handles user login)
    -database.py (Handles data storage)
    -analysis.py (Handles the math)

You can then import these files into your main program to use them.

MODULE VS LIBRARY 
    Module: One single file (.py).
    Package/Library: A folder containing many modules.
    (e.g., Pandas is a library because it has hundreds of files inside it for reading CSVs, plotting, math, etc.).


The Rule: For Python to understand that a folder is a package
(so you can do from my_folder import my_file), that folder usually needs a special file inside it called __init__.py.
What's inside it? Often nothing! It can be an empty file. Its mere existence tells Python: "Treat this directory as a package.

my_project/
|
|----data_processing/     <-----This is a Package
|    |--__init__.py       <-----The flag
|    |--cleaner.py        <-----Module
|    |__loader.py         <-----Module
|
|___main.py

* In main.py, you can now run: from data_processing import cleaner
