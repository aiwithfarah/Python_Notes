In Python, everything is an "Object."
Class : defines the structure (walls, windows). It's just a template
Object : This is the actual house built from that blueprint.
  You can build 50 houses (Objects) from one blueprint (Class).
  Each house has different owners and colors, but the same structure.

Syntax : class keyword
Inside a class, functions are called Methods. There is one special method you must know: __init__.
__init__ (The Constructor): This runs automatically the moment you create a new object.
    It sets up the initial data.
self: This is the most confusing word for beginners. self just means "My own data."
     It allows each object to know its own specific values.


# 1. Define the Class (The Blueprint)
class Dog:
    # The Setup Function (Constructor)
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name   # Save 'name' into MY memory
        self.breed = breed # Save 'breed' into MY memory

    # A Custom Method (Action)
    def bark(self):
        print("Woof! My name is " + self.name)

# 2. Create Objects (Build the Houses)
dog1 = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
dog2 = Dog("Rex", "German Shepherd")

# 3. Use them
print(dog1.breed)  # Output: Golden Retriever
dog2.bark()        # Output: Woof! My name is Rex


** Why self matters: When dog2.bark() runs, self.name knows to look for "Rex", not "Buddy".
 self connects the code to that specific object's data.
