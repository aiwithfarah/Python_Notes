# Write an equation that uses multiplication, division, an exponent, addition, and subtraction that is equal to 100.25.

# What is the value of the expression 4 * (6 + 5) --> 44

# What is the value of the expression 4 * 6 + 5 --> 29

# What is the value of the expression 4 + 6 * 5 --> 34

# What is the type of the result of the expression 3 + 1.5 + 4?  -> float

# What would you use to find a number’s square root, as well as its square? --> exponentiation
# 100 ** 0.5 --> 10.0 square roort
# 10 ** 2 --> 100 square

# Given the string 'hello' give an index command that returns 'e'. Enter your code in the cell below:
# 'hello'[1]

# Reverse the string 'hello' using slicing:
# greeting = "hello"
# print(greeting[::-1]) #olleh

# Given the string hello, give two methods of producing the letter 'o' using indexing.
# print(greeting[-1])
# print(greeting[4])

# Build this list [0,0,0] two separate ways.
# print([0]*3)

# Reassign 'hello' in this nested list to say 'goodbye' instead:
# list3 = [1, 2, [3, 4, 'hello']]
# list3[2][2] = "goodbye"
# print(list3) #[1, 2, [3, 4, 'goodbye']]

# Using keys and indexing, grab the 'hello' from the following dictionaries:
# d = {'simple_key': 'hello'}
# print(d['simple_key']) #hello

# d = {'k1': {'k2': 'hello'}}
# print(d['k1']['k2']) #hello

# d = {'k1': [{'nest_key': ['this is deep', ['hello']]}]}
# print(d['k1'][0]['nest_key'][1][0])

# d = {'k1': [1, 2, {'k2': ['this is tricky', {'tough': [1, 2, ['hello']]}]}]}
# print(d['k1'][2]['k2'][1]['tough'][2][0])

# Use a set to find the unique values of the list below:
# list5 = [1, 2, 2, 33, 4, 4, 11, 22, 3, 3, 2]
# new_set = set(list5)
# print(new_set)  # {1, 2, 33, 4, 3, 11, 22}
