# Let's use while loops to create a guessing game.

# The Challenge:

# Write a program that picks a random integer from 1 to 100, and has players guess the number. The rules are:

# If a player's guess is less than 1 or greater than 100, say "OUT OF BOUNDS"
# On a player's first turn, if their guess is
# within 10 of the number, return "WARM!"
# further than 10 away from the number, return "COLD!"
# On all subsequent turns, if a guess is
# closer to the number than the previous guess return "WARMER!"
# farther from the number than the previous guess, return "COLDER!"
# When the player's guess equals the number, tell them they've guessed correctly and how many guesses it took!
